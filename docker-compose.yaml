# Bookstack Wiki Docker Compose File
#
#   This docker compose file defines all the containers and services needed to run a 
#   Bookstack wiki instance.

    # These ports are commented out as you don't really need this port
    # exposed for normal use, mainly only if connecting directly to the
    # database externally. Otherwise, this risks exposing access to the
    # database when not needed.
